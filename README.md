#DESCRIPTION#
TASK: FILE HANDLING PROGRAM IN C 
      I HAVE GIVEN A FILE HANDLING PROGRAM IN WHICH IT INCLUDED CREATING, WRITING, READING AND APPENDING DATA TO A FILE
      So in this the program required:
            CREATING A FILE- the program should prompt the user to enter a filename and create a new file with that name.
            WRITING A  FILE- the program should allow user to input data and write it to the newly created file.
            READING A FILE- the program should read th data from the file and display it on screen.
            APPENDING A FILE- the program allow user to input additional data and append it to existing file.
            ERROR HANDLING- the program handles the error that may occurs during file operation.
      THE FILE HANDLING FUNCTIONS USED IN THIS PROGRAM ARE:
            fopen()- to open a file in read, write, or append mode
            fclose()- to close a file
            fprintf()- to write data to a file

      So these are the programs and functions that are required in the task. i have also taken help from youtube and google from website geeks for geeks.
      The program has been coded on VISUAL STUDIO CODE and i have pasted it on my GITHUB account.

      THANK YOU
